PacFinder Release Notes
=======================

2022-03-27 - PacFinder 1.2

   shown without needing to restart the program [GH-7]
 - Add error handling for broken pacman configurations
 - Fix dependency list entries in some cases linking to an uninstalled package
   that provides the dependency named in the list, instead of linking to the
   installed package satisfying the dependency, and showing an incorrect install
   status icon [GH-9]

   minimum width limit of 50 pixels enforced on saved column widths [GH-3]
 - Fix "optional" and "optional for" dependency list entries showing incorrect
   names if the optional dependency description included a colon [GH-8]
